#! # Security management of IGNUCIUS
#! System has a vulnerable CPU (...) that needs management to be suitable for high-security mission-critical environment
#!
#! ## Management of TSX Asynchronous Abort
#! TAA (CVE-2019-11135) is a hardware vulnerability that allows unprivileged speculative access to data which is available in various CPU internal buffers by using asynchronous aborts within an Intel TSX transactional region, refer to https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html for more info.
#!
#! The management of this problem is done in upstream linux and allows administrators to adjust the way that the management is enforced, for our infrastructure it's expected to enforce full mitigation to comply with paranoid setup.
