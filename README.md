# NiXium (N/X)

Transparent Nix-based Open-Source Infrastructure as Code (OSS IaaC) Management Solution for Multiple Systems and Domains designed to be a reliable tool for mission-critical tasks in paranoid and high-security environment.

We are using:
* [disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) for filesystem management
* [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence) to enforce fully declarative setup
* [flake-parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts) for nix flake management
* [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) for user configuration
* [ragenix](https://github.com/yaxitech/ragenix) for Secrets
* [mission-control](https://github.com/Platonic-Systems/mission-control) to administrate this repository
* [lanzaboote](https://github.com/nix-community/lanzaboote) for declarative secure boot
* [nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) to generate filesystem images

Trusted community members are welcomed to commit their systems for collective administration and share of resources.

## Provided Public Services

### Monero Node

We provide a Private [Monero Node](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/node.html) for all viewers of this repository to process your [Monero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monero) transactions through our transparent infrastructure:

```
Hostname: jj6qehtyrfvvi4gtwttpg2qyaukqzxwaoxvak534nidlnnelmqtlm3qd.onion
Port: 18081
Username: Monerochan
Password: iL0VEMoNeRoChan<3
```

We recommend to [MapAddress](https://manpages.org/tor) this Onion URL as `monero.nx` for ease of use.

## Claim of "NX" Custom Top Level Domain

This repository claims the "NX" as it's Custom Top Level Domain ("cTLD") and kindly asks all DNS providers and Network Solutions to acknowledge it, we don't recognize the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN") as authority due to their monopolistic position on assignments of Top Level Domains and their unreasonable high fees for cTLDs to attempt to decentralize this assignment.

## Contributions

### Generic Changes

All changes need to be discussed in a form of an issue to be approved for merge with the exception of "Tagged Code" which is always up for grabs.

### Tagged Code

Tagged Code is code that has a "tag" over it:

```nix
# FIXME-QA(Krey): Make it possible to accept list of strings for better readability without the `toString`
# FIXME-QA(Krey): Figure out how to get a list of unsigned integers into a string `${toString config.services.tor.settings.SOCKSPort}` in `proxy` and `tx-proxy` for Tor port
# FIXME-UPSTREAM(Krey): These options should be added to NixOS Module for better maintanability
services.monero.extraConfig = toString [
  "prune-blockchain=1" # Use the pruned blockchain to save space
  "proxy=127.0.0.1:9050" # Use Tor Proxy to access the internet
  ...
];
```

Which is the self-review which the developer adds in a scenario where they were unable to address the issue in a reasonable amount of time during their development which doesn't block merge. Those are often cosmetic, maintainability and readability issues. If you use the repository-provided vscodium, then you will get a configured extension to find these easily or you can run:

```console
$ grep -A 10 -rP "(FIXME|DOCS|)((\\-.*|)\\(.*\\))" /path/to/this/repository
```

To get them printed in your terminal.

### Donate - Finance

For financial aid to help us maintain the system and continue provide the public services we accept Monero, refer to https://github.com/Kreyren#donate for details.

### Donate - Hardware

We are almost always accepting any functional or broken hardware (notebooks, phones, PCs, etc..) to either refurbish for resell or add to our infrastructure.

If you want to donate Hardware then contact [@Kreyren](https://github.com/Kreyren) or make a new issue, preferably in the central europe area.

Kreyren: I also accept broken/locked iDevices (please don't send me stolen devices, return them to their owners instead) as apple often artificially shortens their lifespan through various means e.g. serilizing the replacement parts, making the glass replacement extremly uneconomical, etc.. to force their customers to buy a new model and I like to mess with Apple by fixing them and selling them for cheap, [installing Linux on them](https://git.dotya.ml/kreyren/kreyren/issues/81) or [making new PCBs with better chips](https://git.dotya.ml/kreyren/kreyren/issues/30)~

## Krey Nix Tips

### Update your NixOS and other inputs

To update NixOS (and other inputs) run `nix flake update`

You may also update a subset of inputs, e.g.
```console
$ nix flake lock --update-input nixpkgs --update-input home-manager
```

### Free Up The Disk Space

To free up disk space you can clear unused nixos generations
```console
# nix-env -p /nix/var/nix/profiles/system --delete-generations +2 # Remove all NixOS Generations but last 2
# nixos-rebuild boot # Build a new generation and deploy it on next reboot
```

This can easily safe you few Gigabytes if you don't have set maximum number of generations.
